can any  one tell how to Get result that Number can not be divide by zero..instead of Infinity..Here I am getting Result as Infinity when i try to divide by zero




System.out.println("Enter the Number of number you want to Divide and give any character to get result");

				double answer = s.nextDouble();

				while (true) {
					
					s.nextLine();
					
					if (!s.hasNextDouble())
						break;

					answer /= s.nextDouble();
				}

				System.out.println(answer);
